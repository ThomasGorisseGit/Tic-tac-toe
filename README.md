# Tic-tac-toe
Here is a little project using a MVC architecture to implement a Tic Tac Toe game in Python


In order to play against an AI, I implemented the algorithm Minimax. The AI always plays the best move and the game always finish either in a draw or a loss.


In order to play, you can start the game by running the Launcher.
